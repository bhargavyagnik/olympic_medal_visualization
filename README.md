# olympic_medal_visualization
Visualization for the dataset on Kaggle about Olympic medals  
Get the Dataset at [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games)  
This Dataset contains both Summer and Winter Olympics

So I have used this dataset and created various important visualizations considering various Countries, Sports, Players, Years etc.
More visualizations can be still added
